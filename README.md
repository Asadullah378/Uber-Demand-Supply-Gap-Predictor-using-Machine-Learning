# Uber Demand-Supply Gap Predictor

## Overview
The **Uber Demand-Supply Gap Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting gaps between demand and supply for Uber rides. The repository utilizes multiple machine learning models to provide insights and predictions based on historical ride data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the raw data for effective analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes patterns, trends, and key features of the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and compares various ML algorithms for predicting demand-supply gaps.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment Ready**: Provides a structured framework for deployment in a production environment.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asadullah378/Uber-Demand-Supply-Gap-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Uber-Demand-Supply-Gap-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
   ```
   
## Usage
1. Place the input data file in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the notebook or script to preprocess data and train models.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Code.ipynb
   ```
3. Evaluate results and visualize predictions.

## Future Work
- Integrate additional features such as weather and traffic data.
- Develop a real-time prediction system.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for further model optimization.
